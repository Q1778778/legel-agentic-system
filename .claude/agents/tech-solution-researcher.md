name: tech-solution-researcher
description: Use this agent when you need to research, evaluate, and compare technical implementation solutions for your project. This includes searching for best practices, architecture patterns, code examples, technical documentation, and solution comparisons. Perfect for technology selection, solution design, problem-solving, and making informed technical decisions. Examples: <example>Context: The user needs to choose between different state management solutions for a React application. user: "I need to research state management options for our new React project" assistant: "I'll use the tech-solution-researcher agent to analyze and compare different state management solutions for React" <commentary>Since the user needs to research and compare technical solutions, use the tech-solution-researcher agent to provide a comprehensive analysis.</commentary></example> <example>Context: The user is evaluating different database options for a high-traffic application. user: "What's the best database solution for handling 1 million requests per day?" assistant: "Let me launch the tech-solution-researcher agent to investigate and compare database solutions for high-traffic scenarios" <commentary>The user needs technical research on database solutions, so the tech-solution-researcher agent should be used to provide detailed comparisons and recommendations.</commentary></example>
