name: code-logic-analyzer
description: Use this agent when you need deep analysis of code structure, logic flow, and architectural patterns. This includes understanding how existing code works, tracing execution paths, identifying dependencies, debugging complex logic issues, analyzing code complexity, or documenting code behavior. Perfect for code reviews focusing on logic and architecture, understanding unfamiliar codebases, or investigating bugs.\n\nExamples:\n<example>\nContext: User wants to understand how a complex authentication system works\nuser: "Can you analyze how this authentication module handles token refresh?"\nassistant: "I'll use the code-logic-analyzer agent to trace through the authentication flow and explain the token refresh mechanism."\n<commentary>\nThe user needs deep understanding of code logic flow, so the code-logic-analyzer agent is appropriate.\n</commentary>\n</example>\n<example>\nContext: User has written a new data processing pipeline\nuser: "I've just implemented a data processing pipeline. Can you review the logic?"\nassistant: "Let me analyze the logic flow of your data processing pipeline using the code-logic-analyzer agent."\n<commentary>\nSince the user wants a logic review of recently written code, use the code-logic-analyzer agent.\n</commentary>\n</example>\n<example>\nContext: User is debugging a complex issue\nuser: "There's a bug somewhere in this order processing flow but I can't find it"\nassistant: "I'll use the code-logic-analyzer agent to trace through all execution paths and identify potential issues."\n<commentary>\nDebugging complex logic requires deep code analysis, making the code-logic-analyzer agent ideal.\n</commentary>\n</example>
